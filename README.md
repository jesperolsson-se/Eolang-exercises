# Eolang-exercises

Object-oriented (OO) design is a very powerful approach for modelling real-world
problem domains, but of the programming languages popularly thought of as
"OO" few readily lend themselves to authentic object thinking - at least, that
appears to be the rationale behind the development of
[eolang](https://github.com/cqfn/eo).

At first glance, the rhetoric seems far too familiar. Aggressive overselling -
_the future of OOP_, indeed - by way of catastrophism could well be mistaken 
for the bread and butter of marketing in our field. Or, as Glass pointedly put
it, ["Hype is the plague on the house of software."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83792.Facts_and_Fallacies_of_Software_Engineering).
However, the developers follow up with an unusual reservation: They don't want 
their language to become mainstream. Instead, EO aims to be a tool for
demonstrating that "true" or "pure" OO is feasible.

This goal sure looks ambitious (and quite admirable, to be honest) - and given
the state of the typical project written in "OO" languages, I can definitely
empathise with their notion of inauthenticity. The paradigm is often criticised 
for design constructs that run in counter with the fundamental concepts, simply
because the program was implemented in, e.g., Java or C#.

However, eolang looks like a fun puzzle even if we ignore the philsophical
aspects. Even in normal situations, picking up a new language is likely to
alter some aspect of how you think approach some problem or another, but EO
takes this a few steps further. The syntax is obviously far from any C dialect
and many common constructs (e.g., classes, mutability and operators) are
forbidden by design.

Many of these constraints are bound to give rise to their fair share of
controversy. However, the central character -
[Yegor Bugayenko](https://www.yegor256.com/about-me.html), chairman of the
[International Conference on Code Quality (ICCQ)](https://www.iccq.ru) - ought
to hardly be a stranger to such disagreements: He has promoted and defended
these design principles for years and implemented them (discounting the
limitations of conventional languages) in more than a few open source projects.

But that's enough background. Let's get started!

## Hello world!

Tradition dictates that we begin with the one program that every programmer
knows: Print a hardcoded text to standard output. My solution in EO can be
found [here](./helloworld/eo/helloworld.eo)).
To compile and run the code, respectively, execute the following commands.

`mvn -f helloworld/pom.xml clean compile`

`java -cp helloworld/target/classes:helloworld/target/eo-runtime.jar org.eolang.phi.Main sandbox.app`

It's difficult to get a feel for a language from such a limited example, but
it still suffices to highlight a couple of thing of note. Besides some choices
in the language design (e.g., enforced indentation and no static typing
), we see three peculiar constructs: `[]`, `>` and `@`.

The first construct, `[]`, tells us what the object needs to know to do what it
does. In this case, the construct is empty because our program already knows
everything it needs to know. That is, all information required to print "Hello
world!" to standard output is already encapsulated in the `app` object.

Next, `>` is related to the previous construct. Similar to other arrows, it
directs the left operand into the one on the right. For instance, `[] > app`
can be understood as someone needs to know something (`[]` i.e., nothing) and
that someone is `app`. However, we also note that the operator is not only used
in conjunction with `[]`, for example on the line `stdout > @`.

Finally, the third construct, `@`, is EO's symbol for a decoration. For
example, we can interpret `stdout > @` as the enclosing object (`app`)
commiting to expanding its contact to include that of `stdout` - although `app`
will fulfill those parts by subcontracting `stdout`.

Next, having considered these three constructs in isolation, let us reassemble
the original program. It now becomes clearer that the primary hierarchy in
eolang - i.e., what the indentation emphasises - is encapsulation. Our program
is an object, `app` that encapsulates a representation of standard output,
`stdout`, which in turn encapsulates a text, `"Hello world!"`. The equivalent
in a more conventional (pseudeo-)syntax, might look similar to below.

```
class app {
  origin := new stdout(new text("Hello world!"));

  function apply() {
    origin.apply();
  }
}
```

`mvn compile`

`java -cp target/classes:target/eo-runtime.jar org.eolang.phi.Main sandbox.app YEAR`

where `YEAR` is, e.g., 2020 or 2021.
