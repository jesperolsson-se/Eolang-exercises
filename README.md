# Eolang-exercises

Object-oriented design is a very powerful approach for modelling real-world 
problem domains, but of the programming languages popularly thought of as
"object-oriented" few readily lend themselves to authentic object thinking - at
least, that appears to be the rationale behind the development of
[eolang](https://github.com/cqfn/eo).

At first glance, the rhetoric seems far too familiar. Aggressive overselling -
_the future of OOP_, indeed - by way of catastrophism could well be mistaken 
for the bread and butter of marketing in our field. Or, as Glass pointedly put
it, ["Hype is the plague on the house of software."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/83792.Facts_and_Fallacies_of_Software_Engineering).
However, the developers follow up with an unusual reservation: They don't want 
their language to become mainstream.

`mvn compile`

`java -cp target/classes:target/eo-runtime.jar org.eolang.phi.Main sandbox.app YEAR`

where `YEAR` is, e.g., 2020 or 2021.
